# Celebrity Guess Who

Online celebrity themed Guess Who game made with React. A user can play against the computer to guess a celebrity, asking yes or no questions and turning over cards as they rule each character out. 

Note: As we all know with Hollywood, things change quickly. It's likely the computer's answers to questions about relationship status or awards won will go out of date quickly.
